# Bark & Moss Co-Op Game Design Document

## Overview
A stylized, co-op survival game set in a dense, procedurally generated forest. Two players play as a human and a dog, each with distinct abilities and roles. The game emphasizes asymmetrical gameplay, environmental survival, and relaxed exploration, balanced with nighttime threats.

---

## Art & Atmosphere
- **Visual Style**: Bright, warm, low-poly 3D visuals
- **UI Inspiration**: Mix of The First Tree, Haven, Risk of Rain 2, Alto's Adventure
- **Lighting**: Gradient skies, day/night cycle (9min day / 3min night)
- **Environment**: Minecraft-style forest density, but taller and more atmospheric trees
- **Camera**: 3rd-person, close and soft-follow per player (multiplayer)

---

## Platform & Tech
- **Engine**: Godot
- **Platform**: Desktop (Windows), multiplayer via Godot's networking API
- **Multiplayer**: Online (friends-only), players on separate devices using a host-client architecture
- **World Persistence**: Local save file with player positions and inventories

---

## Multiplayer Architecture
- **Model**: Host-client (host acts as authoritative server)
- **Connection**: Lobby code system with optional lightweight signaling server for NAT traversal
- **Join Flow**: Host creates a session and receives a randomly generated 6-character code (e.g., GR73KX); friend enters code to join
- **Role Assignment**: Second player can only choose the unoccupied role (either human or dog)
- **State Sync**: Entity state sync for positions, animations, hunger, etc.
- **Tick Rate**: 30Hz
- **Interpolation**: Simple linear interpolation for smoother remote movement

---

## Save System
- **Format**: JSON for readability and debugging
- **Triggers**: Manual save + autosave every 5 minutes
- **Storage**: One folder per world instance containing metadata and `world.json`
- **Data Saved**:
  - Player inventory and position
  - World state (chopped trees, campfire state)
  - Spawn metadata for animals

---

## Player Characters

### Human
- **Controls**: WASD + mouse look, jump, walk/run toggle, hotbar selection (1‚Äì5 or scroll), interact (E), attack (Left Click), cancel (Right Click or Q)
- **Abilities**:
  - Chop trees with hatchet (default item)
  - Interact with corpses to process meat (requires holding hatchet + light source)
  - Craft weapons from sinew and wood
  - Shoot bow at animals (no spears)
  - Interact with dog to give raw meat
  - Interact with campfire to cook/process
  - Hold Left Click with bow equipped zooms in and shows charging crosshair
- **Restrictions**:
  - Cannot eat raw meat
  - Vulnerable to bears
- **Weapons**: Hatchet (starter), craftable bow (hotbar system)
- **Inventory**: Persisted between sessions and across deaths

### Dog
- **Controls**: WASD + mouse, jump (Space), bite (Hold Left Click), bark (Right Click), drop (Release Left Click)
- **Abilities**:
  - Fast movement (faster than human, slower than deer)
  - Bite (large hitbox, no targeting) to kill rabbits and grab corpses
  - Bark to startle birds or scare bears (3 barks required)
  - Retrieve corpses (drag physics, grab point-based)
- **Behavior**:
  - Dragging slows movement slightly, no reduction in turn speed
  - Dog can get stuck on trees but not on foliage
  - Barking has a hidden 1s cooldown and costs a small amount of hunger
- **Restrictions**:
  - No inventory
  - Must eat raw meat from human or found kills

## Core Systems

### Hunger System
- **Shared Mechanic**: Applies to both human and dog
- **Depletion**: Based on actions (running, hunting, chopping, barking)
- **At 10%**: Can no longer run (walk only)
- **At 0%**: Instant death (player respawns after a short delay, with inventory preserved)
- **Dog can eat raw meat**, **Human must cook food** at campfire
- **Cooked meat restores 60% hunger**
- **All animals provide meat when processed**

### Campfire
- **Functions**:
  - Spawn point
  - Safe zone from bears (affected by line-of-sight and tree shadows)
  - Crafting station
  - Cooking station (10s cook time, all queued meat cooks at once, visible model during cook)
- **Light Radius**:
  - Reduced by nearby trees (blocks light and reduces total range)
  - Bears can enter but retreat after a few seconds in full light

### Day/Night Cycle
- **Day**: 9 minutes, main exploration/hunting window
- **Night**: 3 minutes, high danger (bear spawns)
- **Bear Behavior**:
  - Spawns at night
  - Faster than human, slower than dog
  - Will chase into light but retreat quickly
  - Scared off by 3 dog barks

### World & Terrain
- **Map**: Procedurally generated forest
- **Trees**:
  - Can be chopped down by human
  - Block campfire light until destroyed
  - Disappear after fall animation (no collision)
- **Animals**:
  - **Rabbits**: Dodge human arrows, hunted by dog
  - **Birds**: Flee when dog barks, shot by human
  - **Deer**: Graze, flee early, vulnerable to bow, slightly faster than dog
  - **Bears**: Night predators, chase both players
- **Spawning**:
  - Animals spawn throughout day
  - Must spawn outside player viewports and a set distance away
  - Spawn only in forest zones
  - Dead animals are temporary and do not persist between sessions

### Crafting
- **At Campfire Only**
- **Requires**:
  - Wood (chopped from trees)
  - Sinew (processed from rabbit corpses)
- **Examples**:
  - Bow = Wood + Sinew
  - Cooked Meat = Raw Meat + 10s cook time (visible on campfire)
- **UI**:
  - Activated with `E` near campfire
  - Radial grid layout popup
  - ESC to exit crafting

## UI Design

### HUD Elements
- **Hotbar** (bottom center): 5 slots, scroll or 1‚Äì5 key access
- **Hunger Bar** (bottom left): simple bar with icon and percentage
- **Interaction Prompt** (center bottom): contextual instructions like `E: Cook`, `Hold LMB: Bite`, etc.
- **Compass Markers** (top center or lower edge): icons for campfire üèï, dog üêæ, or carried corpse üéØ
- **Interactable Indicator**: Small icon floats above any interactable object/animal when within range
- **No tooltips on hover**
- **Hunger bar pulses green briefly when eating**

### Inventory UI (Human)
- **Layout**:
  - Opens by holding `Tab` (not toggle)
  - 3x4 grid layout
  - Centered on screen
  - Background grays out while open
- **Contents**:
  - Displays only tools, weapons, and resources
  - Separate designated slots for tools and weapons (not drag-and-drop to hotbar)
- **Tooltips**:
  - Each item has a short "mysterious" description (e.g., "Raw Meat. A bit too chewy to eat. If only I had a way to cook it...")
- **Usage**:
  - Cooked meat is eaten by equipping it and clicking Left Mouse Button
  - Human can interact with dog to give meat
  - Dog cannot give anything to the human

### Audio Settings
- Simple volume sliders:
  - Master Volume
  - Music Volume
  - SFX Volume

## World & Lobby Management

### Main Menu
- **Landing Screen** (similar to Minecraft):
  - Play
  - Join
  - Settings
  - Exit

### Lobby System
- Host generates **lobby code**
- Second player **joins via code**
- Player role selection: joining player can only select the **remaining role** (i.e., no duplicate roles)

### ESC Menu

  - Resume
  - Settings
  - Save & Quit
  - Leave World

### World Browser

## Core Loop Example
1. Spawn at campfire
2. Dog hunts rabbits ‚Üí Human processes corpses ‚Üí Craft bow
3. Dog startles birds ‚Üí Human shoots birds ‚Üí Cooks meat
4. Human chops trees for wood and clear line-of-sight

## TODO Next
- Define player control responsiveness (acceleration, rotation smoothing)
- Create hotbar UX flow for human
- Determine how corpses attach to dog physics
- Set spawn logic rules for different animals
- Begin network testing with Godot multiplayer API
- Implement local JSON or binary save file structure
- Build menu + world manager + lobby connection system
